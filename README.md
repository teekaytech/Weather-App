# Weather-App

> This is a Weather App built with JavaScript &amp; Webpack. It features the use of Asynchronous Javascript & ES6 usage. I used the Open Weather API to consume the weather details. I also processed the data fetched from the API to render in both Celcius & Fahrenheit. The backdrop changes based on the atmospheric condition of the location provided.

> Lastly, I embedded Snowplow Micro Tracker to send some behavioral data to Snowplow Analytics (using AWS pgsql utility) that can be used to make decision now and in the future.

> I used three(3) auto-tracked events (page view, timer tracking, and link clicks). I also used a structured event (trackStructEvent) and all the events are emitted from my app.
