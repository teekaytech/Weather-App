# Weather-App

> This is a Weather App built with JavaScript &amp; Webpack. The project comes at the end of the Asynchronous Javascript and APIs section of my Javascript course. It tests my knowledge about asynchronous communication with promises or async/await and when to use them. I used the Open Weather API to consume the weather details. I also processed the data fetched from the API to render in both Celcius & Fahrenheit. The background changes based on the atmospheric condition of the location provided.
